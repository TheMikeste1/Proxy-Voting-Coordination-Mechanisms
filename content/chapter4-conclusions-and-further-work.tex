\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
Proxy vote systems as a method to increase system accuracy are situational tools.
This technique is best used when one of the distributions of error is asymmetrical,
and thus require the expected distribution of error to be known.
However, under the correct circumstances a proxy vote system can be used to increase
the accuracy of a system.
Additionally, not all proxy vote systems are created equally and some combinations of
voting and weighting mechanisms can be more effective than others.
As such, the proxy vote system and the mechanisms used should be chosen after
understanding the problem for which the system is desired to solve.

Furthermore, the ratio between proxies and inactive agents should be chosen well.
As previously shown, all systems, including weightlessly averaging all agents, benefit
from an appropriate number of agents.
As discussed in~\fullref{sec:how-many-agents}, this sweet spot appears to be between
10 and 15 proxies, with slightly more or less inactive agents.
This may cause using such techniques to be too expensive if it is not possible to use
sufficiently cheap proxies and inactive agents.
However, if such agents are available the proxy vote or weightless average approach
may be able to achieve better performance than alternative techniques that cost more
than the combined sum of the agents used.

Overall, proxy vote systems as a method to increase system accuracy appears to show
promise under some circumstances.
Further research may be required to identify its full capabilities and weaknesses
before its full potential can be exploited.

\section{Further Work and Improvements}\label{sec:further-work-and-improvements}
% FIXME: This might need to be moved to Chapter 4
% - Multiple levels of expertise. Expert voters could have varying levels of
% accuracy, allowing for more complex systems.
% - (If I decide to restrict experts and untrained to the same mins and maxes)
% Allow for untrained to have a lower restriction, making them less accurate.
% - Independently track time, monetary cost, etc. for system cost (described
% in the cost section of Criteria. Useful identifying multiple systems for
% different costs.
% Closer look into instances where proxy voting works better than weightlessly averaging
