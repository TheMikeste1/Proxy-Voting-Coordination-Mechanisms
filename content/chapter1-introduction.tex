- Sensor accuracy is extremely important when taking measurements
- Particularly important when working with high-risk/high-cost scenarios
    - Human life is involved (lunar landers, for example)
    - High financial cost
    - % TODO: Find more specific examples (maybe find papers?)
    - % TODO: Real life examples of situations where better accuracy would help?
- Even taking measurements can be expensive
    - Time-consuming
    - Tedious
    - Cost
        - Financial
        - Effort/Human time
        - CPU time
- It is important to maximize the accuracy of the measurements while minimizing
  costs
    - \textbf{Proposal: Proxy voting measurements}
        - Inspired by "Proxy Voting for Better Outcomes"\cite{Cohensius2017}

\section{Potential Applications}\label{sec:potential_applications}
- % TODO: List potential applications, such as high risk/cost scenarios


\section{Previous Work}\label{sec:previous_work}
- "Proxy Voting for Better Outcomes"\cite{Cohensius2017} explores the idea of
  using proxy voters to reduce, and even minimize under some voting mechanisms,
  the social cost of voting.
    - Paper assumes infinite voters, but I use finite voters (as few as possible)

Research to be done:
- Finite proxy voting
- Current sensor error mitigation techniques
- Typical sensor error rates
- Sensor error distributions (e.g.\ Gaussian)
- Any similar papers
