The ability to correctly take measurements is an important part of human
progress, both in terms of every day lives and the advancement of science.
Having the ability to take highly precise and accurate measurements is essential
to maintaining safety, ensuring research is accurate, and providing a higher
quality of life.
This is particularly critical in high-risk or high-cost scenarios, such as when
human life is involved or when using a sensor or taking a measurement is
particularly expensive.  % Maybe expand on what "expensive" means?
This paper explores the idea of using and adapted form of proxy voting, as
described in~\cite{Cohensius2017}.

\textit{Proxy voting} involves allowing agents to transfer their voting power
from themselves to another agent, known as a \textit{proxy}\cite[para. 1.4]
{Cohensius2017}.
In doing so, the transferring agent looses their ability to directly affect the
voting game.
In other words, the transferring agent does not vote in an election but rather
affects the election vicariously through the proxy to which they transferred
their power.





- Sensor accuracy is extremely important when taking measurements
- Particularly important when working with high-risk/high-cost scenarios
    - Human life is involved (lunar landers, for example)
    - High financial cost
    - % TODO: Find more specific examples (maybe find papers?)
    - % TODO: Real life examples of situations where better accuracy would help?
- Even taking measurements can be expensive
    - Time-consuming
    - Tedious
    - Cost
        - Financial
        - Effort/Human time
        - CPU time
- It is important to maximize the accuracy of the measurements while minimizing
  costs
    - \textbf{Proposal: Proxy voting measurements}
        - Inspired by "Proxy Voting for Better Outcomes"\cite{Cohensius2017}

\section{Potential Applications}\label{sec:potential-applications}
- % TODO: List potential applications, such as high risk/cost scenarios

\section{Previous Work}\label{sec:previous-work}
- "Proxy Voting for Better Outcomes"\cite{Cohensius2017} explores the idea of
  using proxy voters to reduce, and even minimize under some voting mechanisms,
  the social cost of voting.
    - Paper assumes infinite voters, but I use finite voters (as few as possible)
    - Discuss voting mechanisms and discoveries
    - Explain how what I'm doing is different

Research to be done:
- Any similar papers
- Finite proxy voting
% Those below will likely require a specific type of sensor
- Current sensor error mitigation techniques
- Typical sensor error rates
- Sensor variance
- Sensor error distributions (e.g.\ Gaussian)
