\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future-work}
This study has investigated different methods to aggregate proxy votes, as well as
determining techniques to allow proxies and their constituents to work together.
Nevertheless, there are several additional topics that could be further investigated.

We have shown proxy voting is not particularly beneficial in polarized topics and
when discussion changes preferences.
While some experimentation was done with introducing a penalty to encourage
participation, additional techniques should be developed.

Additionally, more coordination mechanisms and voting mechanisms would be beneficial.
We primarily used previously know techniques to aggregate votes, but research may
find a technique would be able to negate the downsides of the aforementioned
weaknesses of proxy voting.
