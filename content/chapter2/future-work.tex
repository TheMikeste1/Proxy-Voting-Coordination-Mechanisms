\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future-work}
This study has investigated different methods to aggregate proxy votes, as well as
determined techniques to allow proxies and their constituents to work together.
Nevertheless, several additional avenues could be further investigated.

While we have shown it is better to use proxy voting than to not allow
inactive agents to vote at all, proxy voting has clear weaknesses.
Specifically, we have shown proxy voting is not as beneficial for polarized
topics and when deliberations change agents' preferences.
We have suggested potential techniques that may help with these weaknesses,
specifically introducing a penalty for not being active and limiting the number of
agents that are allowed to be inactive.
However, these techniques should be investigated to determine their merit.
Other error mitigation techniques should also be investigated to ensure proxy voting
remains a beneficial tool.

Finally, more coordination mechanisms and voting mechanisms would be beneficial.
We primarily used previously known methods to aggregate votes, but research may
find a technique that would be able to negate the downsides of the aforementioned
weaknesses of proxy voting.
