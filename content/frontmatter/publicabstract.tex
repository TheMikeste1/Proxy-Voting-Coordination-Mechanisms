Proxy voting is a type of voting where individuals are able to pass their votes to
someone else so they may vote for them.
This type of voting system allows for those without the time or knowledge necessary
to become informed on a topic to pass their votes to an individual they trust who
knows more about the topic, dubbed an expert.
This study investigates the ability of proxy vote systems to be used as a way to make
taking measurements more accurate by allowing less expensive measurements to pass their
vote on to more expensive `expert' measurement techniques.
