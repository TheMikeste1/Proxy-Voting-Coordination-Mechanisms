% TODO: I'm not so sure this equation is correct. Should it simply be the unweighted version.
%   Consider how mean and median are calculated. They make sense because each agent has a weight of 1. However, unweighted midrange ignores those weights and simple takes the larges and smallest votes. Should the "weighted" version not also ifnore those weights?
