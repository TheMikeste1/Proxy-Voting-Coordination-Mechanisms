\chapter{RESULTS}\label{ch:results}
This chapter attempts to answer the questions previously outlined in the
\hyperref[subsec:analysis]{Analysis} section.
Each section is dedicated to exploring one question.
The process used is described in each section though the process usually
consists of using a combination of graphing, One-way ANOVA tests, and
Student's t- or Mann-Whitney U-tests.
All tests are performed with $\alpha = 0.05$ unless otherwise stated.

\section{Lowest Error Voting Mechanisms}\label{sec:lowest-error-voting-mechanism}
Voting mechanisms consolidate the votes of all agents along with their weights
into a final estimate, and so play a pivotal role in the accuracy of a system.
\autoref{fig:voting-mechanisms-comparison} illustrates the population of
squared error for each voting mechanism.

    \caption{Squared error populations by voting mechanism, with average
    mechanisms on the left and candidate mechanisms on the right.}
    \label{fig:voting-mechanisms-comparison}
\end{figure}

This graph immediately tells us a few things.
First, the squared error seems to be skewed, favoring numbers closer to 0.
This means there is a fairly even spread of estimates, since this is the
pattern one would expect to see from a uniform distribution of estimates.
Interestingly, however, is the majority of most error populations are
somewhere between a uniform distribution of estimates
(\autoref{fig:expected_even_distribution_squared_error}) and a normal
distribution (\autoref{fig:expected_gaussian_distribution_squared_error}).
Indeed, if the estimates are instead graphed as in
\autoref{fig:voting_mechanisms_estimate_distribution}, the distribution of estimates
is more normal than uniform.
This means most mechanisms are better at estimating \truth\ than random chance.

Additionally, while all distributions appear generally close, there appears to be a
slight difference between average and candidate mechanisms.
This can be confirmed by comparing the average mechanisms to the candidate mechanisms
using a Mann-Whitney U-test, with the alternative being the average mechanisms'
squared error is lesser.
Performing such a test results in a p-value of 0.0, far below the $\alpha$ of 0.05.
Since candidate mechanisms can still be useful depending on the situation, both the
best average mechanisms and the best candidate mechanisms will be identified.

Further U-tests were performed, comparing each individual voting mechanism against
every other individual mechanism.
The results of this analysis can be found in
\autoref{fig:all-voting-mechanisms-p-values}, and is further segmented and discussed in
\autoref{subsec:lowest-error-average-mechanisms} and
\autoref{subsec:lowest-error-candidate-mechanisms}.

\subsection{Average Mechanisms}\label{subsec:lowest-error-average-mechanisms}
Average mechanisms, as described in \autoref{subsubsec:average-mechanisms}, work by
averaging the estimates of the system's agents, so it is not too surprising they
result in less error than candidate mechanisms, which ultimately output a single
agent's estimate.
However, they are not all created equally.
This leads us to the question: which average mechanisms generally work best?

To start, an ANOVA test was performed on the average mechanisms.
This produced a p-value of 0, indicating there is very likely a difference between
average mechanisms.
U-tests were then performed to compare each mechanism on its own against each other
mechanism individually, resulting in \autoref{fig:average-mechanisms-p-values}.
The numbers next to the edges are the resultant p-values, where the alternative is
the population is lower than the other.
As is shown by the graph, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis
than any of the populations are the same.

    \caption{The p-values for average voting mechanisms, given the alternative is one
    population is lesser than the other.
    An arrow pointing to another voting mechanism indicates the `from' mechanism
    beats the `to' mechanism.}
    \label{fig:average-mechanisms-p-values}
\end{figure}

In addition, Ranked Choice appears to beat out every other voting mechanism, followed
by Mean beating two, then Weight by Instant Runoff beating one, and finally Averaged
Weighted Instant Runoff beating none.
This means the rankings of the average mechanisms is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \hyperref[para:avg-ranked-choice]{Ranked Choice}
    \item \hyperref[para:mean]{Mean}
    \item \hyperref[para:avg-instant-runoff]{Weight by Instant Runoff}
    \item \hyperref[para:avg-avg-instant-runoff]{Averaged Weighted Instant Runoff}
\end{enumerate}
