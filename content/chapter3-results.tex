\chapter{RESULTS}\label{ch:results}
This chapter attempts to answer the questions previously outlined in the
\hyperref[subsec:analysis]{Analysis} section.
Each section is dedicated to exploring one question.
The process used is described in each section though the process usually
consists of using a combination of graphing, One-way ANOVA tests, and
Student's t- or Mann-Whitney U-tests.

% TODO: Does "Best Overall" sound good, or does ". . . Analysis" sound
% better? Or should I use something else entirely? Optimal? Lowest Error?
\section{Lowest Error Voting Mechanisms}\label{sec:best-overall-voting-mechanism}
Voting mechanisms consolidate the votes of all agents along with their weights
into a final estimate, and so play a pivotal role in the accuracy of a system.
\autoref{fig:voting_mechanisms_comparison} illustrates the population of
squared error for each voting mechanism.

    mechanisms on the left and candidate mechanisms on the right.}

\end{figure}

This graph immediately tells us a few things.
First, the squared error seems to be skewed, favoring numbers closer to 0.
This means there is a fairly even spread of estimates, since this is the
pattern one would expect to see from a uniform distribution of estimates.
Interestingly, however, is the majority of most error populations are
somewhere between a uniform distribution of estimates
(\autoref{fig:expected_even_distribution_squared_error}) and a normal
distribution (\autoref{fig:expected_gaussian_distribution_squared_error}).
Indeed, if the estimates are instead graphed as in
\autoref{fig:voting_mechanisms_estimate_distribution}, the distribution of estimates
is more normal than uniform.
This means most mechanisms are better at estimating \truth\ than random chance.
