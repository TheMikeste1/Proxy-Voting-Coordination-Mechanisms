\chapter{RESULTS}\label{ch:results}
This chapter attempts to answer the questions previously outlined in the
\hyperref[subsec:analysis]{Analysis} section.
Each section is dedicated to exploring one question.
The process used is described in each section, though the analysis usually consists
of using a combination of graphing, one-way ANOVA tests, and Mann-Whitney
U-tests.
ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U-tests, hereafter called simply `U-tests,' are statistical
analysis tests used to identify differences between populations of statistics.
ANOVA serves to determine if any of several populations is different, whereas U-tests
are able to compare populations one-on-one and so pinpoint which ones are different.
The reason U-tests are used instead of the possibly more well-known Student's t-test
is, as will be show later, the squared error populations are all asymmetrically
distributed which is better handled by U-tests.
All tests are performed with $\alpha = 0.05$ unless otherwise stated.


\section{Lowest Error Voting Mechanisms}\label{sec:lowest-error-voting-mechanism}
Voting mechanisms consolidate the votes of all agents along with their weights
into a final estimate, and so play a pivotal role in the accuracy of a system.
\autoref{fig:voting-mechanisms-comparison} illustrates the population of
squared error for each voting mechanism.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.75]
    {./content/figures/voting_mechanisms/voting_mechanisms_comparison}
    \caption{Squared error populations by voting mechanism, with average
    mechanisms on the left and candidate mechanisms on the right.}
    \label{fig:voting-mechanisms-comparison}
\end{figure}

This graph immediately tells us a few things.
First, the squared error seems to be skewed, favoring numbers closer to 0.
This means there is a fairly even spread of estimates, since this is the
pattern one would expect to see from a uniform distribution of estimates.
Interestingly, however, the majority of error for most populations is
somewhere between a uniform distribution of estimates
(\autoref{fig:expected_even_distribution_squared_error}) and a normal
distribution (\autoref{fig:expected_gaussian_distribution_squared_error}).
Indeed, if the estimates are instead graphed as in
\autoref{fig:voting_mechanisms_estimate_distribution}, the distribution of estimates
is more normal than uniform.
This means most mechanisms are better at estimating \truth\ than random chance.

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Additionally, while all distributions appear generally close, there appears to be a
slight difference between average and candidate mechanisms.
This can be confirmed by comparing the average mechanisms to the candidate mechanisms
using a U-test, with the alternative being that one population has lower error than the
other.
Performing such a test results in a p-value of 0.0, far below the $\alpha$ of 0.05.
Since candidate mechanisms can still be useful depending on the situation, both the
best average mechanisms and the best candidate mechanisms will be identified.

% \vicki{Need to define U-tests.
% It seems biased that everyone know the true value. When you know the true value, lots
% of subtle ways of cheating could get you closer. You only have a true test when the
% voters don't know the correct answer.}
Further U-tests were performed, comparing each individual voting mechanism against
every other individual mechanism.
The results of this analysis can be found in
\autoref{fig:all-voting-mechanisms-p-values}, and is further segmented and discussed in
\autoref{subsec:lowest-error-average-mechanisms} and
\autoref{subsec:lowest-error-candidate-mechanisms}.

\subsection{Average Mechanisms}\label{subsec:lowest-error-average-mechanisms}
Average mechanisms, as described in \autoref{subsubsec:average-mechanisms}, work by
averaging the estimates of the system's agents, so it is not too surprising they
result in less error than candidate mechanisms, which ultimately output only a single
agent's estimate.
However, they are not all created equally.
This leads us to the question: which average mechanisms generally work best?

To start, an ANOVA test was performed on the average mechanisms.
This produced a p-value of 0, indicating there is very likely a difference between
average mechanisms.
U-tests were then performed to compare each mechanism against every other
mechanism individually, resulting in \autoref{fig:average-mechanisms-p-values}.
The numbers next to the edges are the resultant p-values, where the alternative is
that one population has lower error than the other.
As is shown by the graph, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis
that any of the populations are the same.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.75]
    {./content/figures/voting_mechanisms/average-mechanisms-p-values.gv}
    \caption{The p-values for average voting mechanisms, given the alternative is
    that one population has lower error than the other.
    An arrow pointing to another voting mechanism indicates the `from' mechanism
    beats the `to' mechanism.}
    \label{fig:average-mechanisms-p-values}
\end{figure}

In addition, Ranked Choice appears to beat out every other voting mechanism, followed
by Mean beating two, then Weight by Instant Runoff beating one, and finally Averaged
Weighted Instant Runoff beating none.
\begin{samepage}
    This means the rankings of the average mechanisms is as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \hyperref[para:avg-ranked-choice]{Ranked Choice}
        \item \hyperref[para:mean]{Mean}
        \item \hyperref[para:avg-instant-runoff]{Weight by Instant Runoff}
        \item \hyperref[para:avg-weighted-instant-runoff]{Averaged Weighted Instant
        Runoff}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{samepage}

\subsection{Candidate Mechanisms}\label{subsec:lowest-error-candidate-mechanisms}
Candidate voting mechanisms are described in \autoref{subsubsec:candidate-mechanisms}.
They work by selecting a single proxy as the `candidate' and using its vote as
\systemtruth.
While they do not appear to perform as well as average mechanisms, there may be
circumstances where they are required.
As such, they will still be examined to determine which candidate mechanism works best.

An ANOVA analysis was again used to start, which resulted in a p-value of
$2.49e-221$.
This, again, is clearly below $\alpha$, so the null hypothesis that all populations
are the same can be rejected.
Following the pattern of analysis in
\autoref{subsec:lowest-error-average-mechanisms}, U-tests were then performed to
identify which mechanisms produced lower error than others.
The p-values can be found in \autoref{fig:candidate-mechanisms-p-values}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.75]
    {./content/figures/voting_mechanisms/candidate-mechanisms-p-values.gv}
    \caption{The p-values for candidate voting mechanisms, given the alternative is
    that one population has lower error than the other.
    An arrow pointing to another voting mechanism indicates the `from' mechanism
    beats the `to' mechanism.}
    \label{fig:candidate-mechanisms-p-values}
\end{figure}

While not as many candidate mechanism tests yielded p-values as small as those of
the average mechanisms, there is still very strong evidence that each candidate
mechanism is different from the others.
For the candidate mechanisms, Median appears to be the best, followed
by Plurality, Instant Runoff, and finally Weighted Instant Runoff.
\begin{samepage}
    This means the rankings of the candidate mechanisms is as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \hyperref[para:median]{Median}
        \item \hyperref[para:plurality]{Plurality}
        \item \hyperref[para:cand-instant-runoff]{Instant Runoff}
        \item \hyperref[para:cand-weighted-instant-runoff]{Weighted Instant Runoff}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{samepage}


\section{Lowest Error Weighting Mechanisms}\label{sec:lowest-error-weighting-mechanism}
Weighting mechanisms have a direct influence on how voting mechanisms operate in that
they apply weights to the estimates of the proxies.
This naturally has a direct impact on the output of a system.
\autoref{fig:weighting-mechanisms-comparison} illustrates the population of
squared error for each weighting mechanism.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.75]
    {./content/figures/weighting_mechanisms/weighting_mechanisms_comparison}
    \caption{Squared error populations by weighting mechanism.}
    \label{fig:weighting-mechanisms-comparison}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[htbp]

    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.0}

    \caption{The mean squared error for each mechanism, ordered lowest to highest.}
    \label{tab:weighting-mechanism-mean-error}

    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        Weighting Mechanism & Mean Squared Error \\
        \hhline{|=|=|}
        Closest             & 0.269045           \\
        \hline
        Distance            & 0.275722           \\
        \hline
        Borda               & 0.276065           \\
        \hline
        Equal Weight        & 0.328497           \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

While the mechanisms definitely appear close, there is a visible difference between
the Equal Weight mechanism and the other mechanisms.
This can be confirmed using a series of U-tests, resulting in
\autoref{fig:weighting-mechanisms-p-values}.
\begin{samepage}
    This gives us the ordering:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \hyperref[para:closest]{Vote for Closest}
        \item \hyperref[para:borda]{Borda}
        \item \hyperref[para:distance-voting]{Distance Voting}
        \item \hyperref[para:equal-weight]{Equal Weight}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{samepage}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.75]
    {./content/figures/weighting_mechanisms/weighting-mechanisms-p-values.gv}
    \caption{The p-values for weighting mechanisms, given the alternative is that one
    population has lower error than the other.
    An arrow pointing to another voting mechanism indicates the `from' mechanism
    beats the `to' mechanism.}
    \label{fig:weighting-mechanisms-p-values}
\end{figure}

These results are somewhat surprising in that the simplest method, arguably barring
Equal Weight, appears to produce the best results.
This may be due to the Closest mechanism yielding a lower system-wide weight while
still maintaining an ordering of preferences.
However, this does not necessarily mean the Closest mechanism pairs best with all
voting mechanisms.
This idea is explored in~\fullref{sec:lowest-error-overall-combination}.


\section{Lowest Error Combination}\label{sec:lowest-error-overall-combination}
While the previous sections have explored the lowest error for each voting mechanism and
weighting mechanism regardless of the mechanism it's paired with, this section will
explore the lowest error for each combination of voting and weighting mechanisms.

The population of error for each combination is displayed in
\autoref{fig:combined-comparison}, where a similar pattern can seen with the voting
mechanisms as what was discussed in \autoref{sec:lowest-error-voting-mechanism}: the
candidate mechanisms tend to be noticeably worse than the average mechanisms.
Additionally, average mechanisms typically produce an error below the weighting
mechanism mean, while candidate mechanisms tend to produce an error that is higher
than the mean.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.75]
    {./content/figures/combinations/combined_comparison}
    \caption{Squared error populations by combination of mechanisms. The red dashed
    line represents the mean for each weighting mechanism, while the black line with
    dots are the means for each voting mechanism using the weighting mechanism.}
    \label{fig:combined-comparison}
\end{figure}

Using U-tests, we can discover which combinations produce the lowest error.
By counting how many times any given combination beats other combinations, we can
produce an overall ranking.
The number of times one combination `beats' another by having a lower error is
displayed in \autoref{fig:combined-lesser_counts}, and is further tabulated in
\autoref{tab:combined-overall-rankings}.
From these tests, we can see the averaged easily dominate, with the first candidate
combination being in rank 15, reinforcing the idea that average mechanisms result in
lower error than candidate mechanisms.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.75]
    {./content/figures/combinations/combined_lesser_counts}
    \caption{The number of times each combination has a lower error according to
    U-tests.}
    \label{fig:combined-lesser_counts}
\end{figure}

From the graph, it can be seen that the findings
in~\fullref{sec:lowest-error-voting-mechanism} hold true with combinations of
mechanisms as well, with Ranked Choice taking the top three ranks.
The rankings from~\fullref{sec:lowest-error-weighting-mechanism} also
generally hold true, since the Closest and Borda mechanisms generally
appear sooner than others.
It is possible, however, that voting mechanisms have a larger impact than weighting
mechanisms, since the general order of rankings more closely follows the voting
mechanism ordering rather than that of the weighting mechanisms.

%% I'm leaving this here in case I want to add it later. For now it seems like overkill
% Nevertheless, there may be occasions when candidate mechanisms may be preferable
% over average mechanisms, and so a deeper dive will be performed on both types of
% voting mechanisms.

\section{Weightlessly Averaging All Agents}\label{sec:weightless-average-all}
% Explain how WeightlessAverageAll works best
While the results thus far have been very interesting, this important, baseline
question remains unanswered: does employing such a system work better than simply
averaging the estimates of all agents?
Such an operation is here dubbed `weightlessly averaging all,' since it ignores
weights and simply averages all agents, including inactive agents.
Thus, this technique does not use a weighting mechanism.
\autoref{fig:weightless-voting-mechanisms-comparison} shows how weightlessly
averaging all agents compares to the other mechanisms, ignoring which weighting
mechanism is used or the distribution of the proxies or inactive agents.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.75]
    {./content/figures/weightless/weightless_voting_mechanisms_comparison}
    \caption{Squared error populations by voting mechanism, with average
    mechanisms on the left and candidate mechanisms on the right.
    Weightlessly averaging all agents' estimates is in the center.}
    \label{fig:weightless-voting-mechanisms-comparison}
\end{figure}

It is immediately evident that weightlessly averaging all agents' estimates works
considerably better that using proxy vote systems.
While this would initially indicate that proxy vote systems should not be used when a
simpler and more accurate technique already exists, this broad overview does not tell
the full story.
As explored previously, each voting mechanism is also paired with a weighting
mechanism that heavily influences its accuracy.
Additionally, we have yet to explore how the proxy and inactive estimate
distributions interact with the different mechanisms.

Indeed, performing tests on groups separated by voting and weighting mechanism, as
well as proxy and inactive estimate distribution, indicates 467 of the 2048 possible
combinations, or 22.80\%, work better using a proxy vote system than weightlessly
averaging.
These tests are performed as if the proxy system were used instead of weightlessly
averaging, meaning that they are performed as if the agents had the same estimate
distribution when weightlessly averaging as they did with the proxy system.

Of these 467 combinations, 223 (47.75\%) have an asymmetric proxy distribution with
a symmetric inactive distribution, while 154 (32.98\%) have an asymmetric inactive
distribution with a symmetric inactive distribution.
Additionally, 78 (16.70\%) use asymmetric distributions for both proxies and
inactive agents.
This totals to 455 (97.43\%) of the 467 more accurate proxy systems that use
asymmetric distributions!

The remaining 12 consist of high-performing voting mechanism/weighting mechanism
combinations, as discovered in \autoref{sec:lowest-error-overall-combination},
using Gaussian or \betadistribution{4}{4} distributions for the proxies,
and \betadistribution{0.3}{0.3} as the inactive distributions.
These combinations are displayed in~\autoref{tab:non-asymmetric-lower-pop-systems}.

However, this does not mean a proxy system is always better when some distribution is
asymmetrical.
The number of lower error asymmetric combinations is only 29.62\% of the 1536
possible combinations with at least one distribution asymmetric, and all 467 lower error
combinations are only 22.80\% of all 2048 combinations.
Ten combinations with at least one asymmetric distribution failed to achieve a lower
error, regardless of the mechanism used.
These combinations are shown in \autoref{tab:no-appearance-distro-combos}.
Of note is in all these combinations, both distributions are asymmetric.
Additionally, whenever an asymmetric distribution is placed with itself, a proxy system
does not produce a lower error.
Finally, the more heavily skewed asymmetric distributions work worse with other
asymmetric distributions.

The natural next question that aries is, `which mechanism combinations are more likely
to produce a lower error?'
The count of how many times each voting/weighting mechanism combination
tests to have a lower error than weightlessly averaging is tabulated
in~\autoref{tab:lower-pop-combo-count}.
This table would seem to indicate that the stronger combinations, as explored
in~\fullref{sec:lowest-error-overall-combination}, are more able to achieve a lower
error.
Surprisingly, even candidate mechanisms are occasionally able to achieve a lower error
as well.

While it is clear that simply weightlessly averaging all agent's estimates is a more
accurate method, there appear to be occasions when proxy vote systems can reduce
error, particularly when one of the error distributions is asymmetrical.
This view into distributions and other parameters begs for a closer look and may yield
fascinating results upon closer inspection.


\section{How many Agents to Use}\label{sec:how-many-agents}
Regardless of which combination of mechanisms is used, the question still remains,
`How many proxies and inactive agents should be used?'
This question directly affects the cost of a system, since the cost is tied to the
number of agents, and so ideally the number of agents should be minimized.

There are three parts to this question, all of which will be addressed here.
The first is how many proxies should be used.
\autoref{fig:proxy-count} shows how proxy count affects the error of a system.
From this graph, we can see in the beginning more proxies produces better results.
However, this benefit reduces over time and eventually flattens out or, in the case
of some combinations, increases the error of a system.
This benefit seems to bottom out between 10 and 15 proxies.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[
        width=\textwidth,
        height=\dimexpr
        \textheight - 4 % Could also be .9\textheight
        \baselineskip,
        keepaspectratio]
    {./content/figures/ratios/proxy_count}
    \caption{How the number of proxies affects the system error.}
    \label{fig:proxy-count}
\end{figure}

The second part of determining how many agents to use is how many inactive agents to
use.
As with minimizing the number of proxies, minimizing the number of inactive agents to
use will help reduce the costs of the system.
\autoref{fig:inactive-count} seems to indicate that, with the exception of
weightlessly averaging all agents, there is little benefit in using more inactive
agents.
This doesn't mean only one inactive agent should be used, as is indicated by the
third part of the question: the ratio between proxies and inactive agents.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[
        width=\textwidth,
        height=\dimexpr
        \textheight - 4 % Could also be .9\textheight
        \baselineskip,
        keepaspectratio]
    {./content/figures/ratios/inactive_count}
    \caption{How the number of inactive agents affects the system error.}
    \label{fig:inactive-count}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:ratios}~and~\ref{fig:ratios-zoomed} display the error in the system as
the ratio between proxies and inactive agents increases, with
\autoref{fig:ratios-zoomed} providing a zoomed-in perspective.
Interestingly, the curve produced in each of these graphs flattens around a 1:1
ratio, indicating that there is little or no benefit to having a differing number of
proxies and inactive agents.
Additionally, there seems to be small `hiccups' at each whole number.
While the reason behind the hiccups is not explored here, this would indicate that a
slightly higher or lower ratio than 1:1 should be used.
With this mind, and since the number of inactive agents generally does not have an
effect on the system error, it would likely be best to use slightly fewer inactive
agents than proxies in an effort to decrease the total system cost while still
maintaining accuracy.
