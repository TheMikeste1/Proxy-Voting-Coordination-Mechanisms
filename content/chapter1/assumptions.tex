\section{Assumptions}\label{sec:assumptions}
In order to conduct this study, we make a number of assumptions.
First, we assume that voting issues are one off, meaning agents vote on only one
topic at a time.
This allows agents to select a proxy that works best for the current topic instead of
selecting the best proxy for all topics.

Additionally, we only consider scenarios where single-vite proxy voting is used, where
the proxy receives the voting power of the delegating voter, increasing their weight,
and proceeds to allocate all their weight towards one vote instead of relaying their
constituents vote.
This type of proxy voting also allows the proxy to update their (and by extension, their
constituents) preferences as new information becomes available.
While single-vote proxy voting gives substantial flexibility to the proxy to operate
on behalf of their constituents, this flexibility requires the delegating voter to
choose a proxy who they trust to vote as close to how they themselves would.
This is a process similar to selecting experts, as described by~\cite{Miller1969}
and~\cite{Mueller1972}.
By using single-vote proxy voting instead of relay-style voting, we hope to exploit
the advantages of proxy voting that the relay-style does not provide.

We also assume that each voter has reasonable knowledge of potential proxies'
opinions, meaning they have a decent idea of the preferences of other proxies.
This will allow them to choose the proxy that has the opinion most similar to their own.
While in reality voters will likely not have perfect knowledge of others' opinions,
it is often not particularly difficult to gauge the opinion of others, especially
those with whom an individual often associates, and so we believe this assumption is
reasonable.

Next, we assume that abstention is not allowed.
In other words, all agents must vote either themselves or by proxy.
The primary reasoning behind this is to simplify the system being used and provide
the system with as much information as possible without needing to account for
extenuating circumstances such as the unexpected incapacitation of a voter.
Nevertheless, as baselines , we will explore occasions where those who are not
physically present are unable to vote as well as the result when all agents are able
to vote.

Finally, we assume that there are no factors besides closeness in opinion that affect
the choice of proxy.
This differs from some systems, such as that presently used by the House of
Representatives which includes restrictions such as a proxy can only serve ten
voters~\cite{CERP2020}.
However, we feel removing restrictions such as these leads to a more interesting
discussion, since it allows the use of different voting mechanisms and more extreme
cases.
