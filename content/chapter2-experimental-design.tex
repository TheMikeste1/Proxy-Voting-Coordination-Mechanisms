\chapter{EXPERIMENT DESIGN}\label{ch:experiment-design}

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:preliminaries}
% Talk basics about voting mechanisms and start explaining weighting mechanisms

\section{Experiment Design}\label{sec:experiment-design}

\subsection{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}
- Infinite (a la \cite{Cohensius2017})
- Finite
- Finite with agent costs

\subsection{Criteria}\label{subsec:criteria}
- Time (squared?)
- Accuracy/Precision \& Recall
- Cost

\subsection{Parameters}\label{subsec:parameters}
- \# of Proxies
- \# of Non-Proxies
- Distribution of votes
    - Uniform
    - Gaussian
    - Bimodal about center
    - Skewed?
- Dimensions?
- Cost per proxy
- Cost per non-proxy



\section{Mechanisms}\label{sec:mechanisms}
- Explain what mechanisms are, as well as my expansion using weight mechanisms.

\subsection{Voting Mechanisms}\label{subsec:voting-mechanisms}
- Explain what voting mechanisms are

\subsubsection{Candidate Mechanisms}\label{subsubsec:candidate-mechanisms}
- Explain what candidate mechanisms are

- Median
- Borda
- Ranked Choice
- Plurality? Likely not going to work well
- . . .

\subsubsection{Average Mechanisms}\label{subsubsec:average-mechanisms}
- Explain what average mechanisms are

- Mean
- Weight by Borda
- Weight by Ranked Choice
- . . .

\subsection{Weight Mechanisms}\label{subsec:weight-mechanisms}
- Explain what weight mechanisms are

- Vote for closest (implemented by \cite{Cohensius2017})
- Borda
- Ranked Choice
- . . .
