    Illness, injury, and other impediments are common occurrences in every day.
    Such impediments prevent or deter agents from participating in important parts
    of the voting process, in particular deliberation, bargaining, and the voting
    itself.
    Without participation, the results of the vote may change.
    There is a need to provide a mechanism by which agents are still able to
    participate in such processes to ensure their vote is represented.
    We examine unified-vote/single-winner
    \vicki{Explain unified-vote}  proxy voting in a one-dimension continuous
    preference space using a combination of $L_p$ aggregation methods.
    As part of this examination, we develop and examine `coordination mechanisms,' by
    which proxies and their constituents are able to find a way to combine their
    preferences in order for constituents to still have their voices heard.
    In exchange, their proxy gains more weight and is able to have a stronger voice in
    deliberations.
    We employ a continuous preference space model and determine the result of a vote
    as a point in the model's space.
    This model allows for more options than the vote only passing or failing by
    allowing the outcome to directly correlate to actions to be taken, such as the
    amount of money to spend.
    Such an ability increases the granularity of the results and allows us to
    better determine how much error is introduced by proxy voting.
    The continuous preference space model also provides a more expressive way of casting a vote.
    We show that proxy voting is effective in many scenarios, and that it is
    consistently better than not allowing inactive agents to vote.
