    From determining the best breakfast cereal~\cite{Curtis2021} to electing the next
    president, voting is an extremely important aspect of modern society.
    Nevertheless, disease, injury, and other impediments can create difficulties for
    individuals participating in such democratic processes, preventing them from
    expressing their voice and participating in deliberation, as well as decreasing
    the overall quality of the result.
    Proxy voting is a method by which participants are able to have others vote on their
    behalf.
    We examine the ability of proxy voting to decrease the impact of such frustrations.
    We additionally determine strategies by which proxies and their constituents can
    cooperate in order to reduce the change their absence would otherwise cause.
    These strategies include allowing proxies and constituents to aggregate their
    preference into one result, as well as determining how best to aggregate all votes in
    a unified-vote/single-winner/single-dimension continuous space model.
