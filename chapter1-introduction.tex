From determining the best breakfast cereal~\cite{Curtis2021} to electing the next
president, voting is an extremely important aspect of modern society.
Nevertheless, disease, injury, and other impediments can create difficulties for
individuals participating in such democratic processes, preventing them from
expressing their voice and participating in deliberation, as well as decreasing
the overall quality of the result.
Proxy voting is a method by which participants are able to have others vote on their
behalf.
We examine the ability of proxy voting to decrease the impact of such frustrations.
We additionally determine strategies by which proxies and their constituents can
cooperate in order to reduce the change their absence would otherwise cause.
These strategies include allowing proxies and constituents to aggregate their
preference into one result, as well as determining how best to aggregate all votes
in a unified-vote/single-winner/single-dimension continuous space model.
