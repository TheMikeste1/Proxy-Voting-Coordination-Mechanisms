From determining the best breakfast cereal~\cite{Curtis2021} to electing the next
president, voting has become an important aspect of modern society.
However, disease, injury, and other impediments can create difficulties for individuals
participating in such democratic processes, preventing them from expressing their
voice and participating in deliberation, as well as decreasing the overall quality of
the result.
Proxy voting is a method by which participants are able to have others vote on their
behalf.
We examine the ability of proxy voting to decrease the impact of such frustrations.
We additionally determine strategies by which proxies and their constituents can
cooperate in order to reduce the change their absence would otherwise cause.
These strategies include allowing proxies and constituents to aggregate their
preference into one result, as well as determining how best to aggregate all votes in
a unified-vote/single-winner/single-dimension continuous space model.
