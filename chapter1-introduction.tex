From determining the best breakfast cereal~\cite{Curtis2021} to electing the next
president, voting has become an important aspect of modern society.
However, disease, injury, and other impediments can create difficulties for individuals
participating in such democratic processes, preventing them from expressing their
voice and participating in deliberation, as well as decreasing the overall quality of
the result.
We examine the ability of proxy voting, a method by which participants are able to
have others vote on their behalf, to decrease the impact of such frustrations.
We additionally determine strategies by which proxies and their constituents can
cooperate in order to reduce the change their absence would otherwise cause.
These strategies include having voters vote in a continuous space, allowing proxies
and constituents to aggregate their preference into one result, as well as
determining how best to aggregate all votes in a single-vote/single-winner 1D
continuous space model.

% This study attempts to answer these questions by analyzing the effects of proxy
% voting on the results of a vote under a number of preference distributions.
% We employ several voting mechanisms and rank them according to their performance when
% applied under several preference distributions.
% We additionally explore the use of cooperative mechanisms, which determine how and
% under what rules proxies cooperate, or don't cooperate, with their constituents.
% Finally, as a part of this study we implement and describe voting over a continuous
% interval instead of the typical binary (in favor or against) vote.
%
% This topic is of large importance because of the potential ramifications of using
% proxy voting directly in the legislative and other processes.
% If proxy voting does not have a large effect on the results of the vote, then it
% can be used to significantly ease the process and lower the risk of participating in
% Congress during pandemics or other emergencies.
% Similarly, if proxy voting can be shown to have a large effect on the results of the
% vote, it would be important to alter the system to mitigate the effects or stop using
% proxy voting altogether.
% In either case, it is important to understand the effects of proxy voting in order to
% utilize it in the most effective way possible, as well as discover any potential
% techniques to improve such a system.
