From determining the best breakfast cereal~\cite{Curtis2021} to electing the next
president, voting has become an important aspect of modern society.
However, disease, injury, and other impediments can create difficulties for individuals
participating in such democratic processes, preventing them from expressing their
voice and participating in deliberation, as well as decreasing the overall quality of
the result.
We examine the ability of \textit{proxy voting}, a method by which participants are able
to have others vote on their behalf, to decrease the impact of such frustrations.
We additionally determine strategies by which proxies and their constituents can
cooperate in order to reduce the change their absence would otherwise cause.
These strategies include having voters vote in a continuous space, allowing proxies
and constituents to aggregate their preference into one result, as well as
determining how best to aggregate all votes.

% On May 13th, 2020, the 116th United States Congress introduced a resolution
% to permit the use of proxy voting during emergencies for members of the House of
% Representatives~\cite{Congress.gov2020}, which would allow members to participate in
% proceedings remotely while still having someone physically present to submit the
% member's vote on their behalf.
% This resolution was passed on May 15th, 2020, and as indicated by proxy designation
% letters sent to the Clerk of the House of Representatives~\cite{Clerk.House.gov2022},
% was put to use as soon as five days later.
% The purpose behind the resolution was to allow the House of Representatives
% to continue operating while still allowing members to quarantine and prevent the
% spread of COVID-19~\cite{Congress.gov2020}, as well as to pave the way for future use
% of proxy voting in other such emergencies.
% The type of proxy voting in Congress is not the traditional type of proxy vote.
% Instead, it is more similar to voting remotely, as quarantining members need to
% meet via video conference and the delegated proxy is required vote exactly as
% directed on behalf of their constituents.
% \vicki{Since you aren't using this type of proxy, why mention it? If the best example
% you can give is one that isn't what you are doing, the reader is confused by why
% proxy voting is important.}
% Nevertheless, using proxy voting in such an important part of the legislative process
% reignites the discussion on the effectiveness of traditional proxy voting where the
% proxy is able to vote on behalf of their constituents as the proxy desires.
% The proxy being able to vote as they desire simplifies the voting process, but
% creates error in that information about the delegators' preferences is lost.
% \vicki{How is it lost if their vote is captured?}
% Does proxy voting introduce too much error into the voting process? \vicki{How is
% error introduced? The reader needs to understand how proxy voting is done.}
% Or is it a viable alternative to direct voting?
% If proxy voting does introduce error, perhaps alternative voting mechanisms or systems
% can be used to mitigate that effect while still maintaining the benefits of proxy
% voting.
%
% This study attempts to answer these questions by analyzing the effects of proxy
% voting on the results of a vote under a number of preference distributions.
% We employ several voting mechanisms and rank them according to their performance when
% applied under several preference distributions.
% We additionally explore the use of cooperative mechanisms, which determine how and
% under what rules proxies cooperate, or don't cooperate, with their constituents.
% Finally, as a part of this study we implement and describe voting over a continuous
% interval instead of the typical binary (in favor or against) vote.
%
% This topic is of large importance because of the potential ramifications of using
% proxy voting directly in the legislative and other processes.
% If proxy voting does not have a large effect on the results of the vote, then it
% can be used to significantly ease the process and lower the risk of participating in
% Congress during pandemics or other emergencies.
% Similarly, if proxy voting can be shown to have a large effect on the results of the
% vote, it would be important to alter the system to mitigate the effects or stop using
% proxy voting altogether.
% In either case, it is important to understand the effects of proxy voting in order to
% utilize it in the most effective way possible, as well as discover any potential
% techniques to improve such a system.
