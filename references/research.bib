  abstract        = {Space and special FPGA applications must consider the radiation effects. Radiation Hardened by Design (RHBD) includes triple redundancy (Triple Modular Redundancy, TMR). Therefore, in FPGA, it is necessary to triple the architecture with separate power supplies. FPGA's Majority Vote Circuits can based on the Look-Up Tables. However, in this case FPGA logic resources are spent. In the Xilinx FPGA Virtex TMR uses internal 3-state buffers instead of Look-Up Tables (LUTs). Simulation shows that in this case six buffers per output are required. The third option uses three buffers and three LUT Minority Vote Circuit. Only in this case, there is no conflict of signals at the outputs of buffers. In this case, the costs are even greater. The paper proposes a fault tolerant 3-State Buffers Based Vote Circuit. Simulation confirms correct functioning of the proposed option and evaluation shows high probability of failure-free operation.},

A common solution to increase participation is to allow voters use a proxy, that is, transfer their voting rights to another voter. Considering social choice problems on metric spaces, we compare voting with and without the use of proxies to see which mechanism better approximates the optimal outcome, and characterize the regimes in which proxy voting is beneficial. When voters' opinions are located on an interval, both the median mechanism and the mean mechanism are substantially improved by proxy voting. When voters vote on many binary issues, proxy voting is better when the sample of active voters is too small to provide a good outcome. Our theoretical results extend to situations where available voters choose strategically whether to participate. We support our theoretical findings with empirical results showing substantial benefits of proxy voting on simulated and real preference data.},

  abstract   = {Liquid democracy is the principle of making collective decisions by letting agents transitively delegate their votes. Despite its significant appeal, it has become apparent that a weakness of liquid democracy is that a small subset of agents may gain massive influence. To address this, we propose to change the current practice by allowing agents to specify multiple delegation options instead of just one. Much like in nature, where—fluid mechanics teaches us—liquid maintains an equal level in connected vessels, we seek to control the flow of votes in a way that balances influence as much as possible. Specifically, we analyze the problem of choosing delegations to approximately minimize the maximum number of votes entrusted to any agent by drawing connections to the literature on confluent flow. We also introduce a random graph model for liquid democracy and use it to demonstrate the benefits of our approach both theoretically and empirically.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, political parties have adopted Online Delegative         Democracy platforms such as LiquidFeedback to organise         themselves and their political agendas via a grassroots         approach. A common objection against the use of these platforms         is the delegation system, where a user can delegate his vote to         another user, giving rise to so-called super-voters, i.e.         powerful users who receive many delegations. It has been         asserted in the past that the presence of these super-voters         undermines the democratic process, and therefore delegative         democracy should be avoided. In this paper, we look at the         emergence of super-voters in the largest delegative online         democracy platform worldwide, operated by Germany's Pirate         Party. We investigate the distribution of power within the party         systematically, study whether super-voters exist, and explore         the influence they have on the outcome of votings conducted         online. While we find that the theoretical power of super-voters         is indeed high, we also observe that they use their power         wisely. Super-voters do not fully act on their power to change         the outcome of votes, but they vote in favour of proposals with         the majority of voters in many cases thereby exhibiting a         stabilising effect on the system. We use these findings to         present a novel class of power indices that considers observed         voting biases and gives significantly better predictions than         state-of-the-art measures.},

This work attempts to give a mathematical explanation of this phenomenon. We quantify the gap between the outcomes of two voting rules by the pairwise margin between their winners. We show that for many common voting rules, the gap between them can be almost as large as 1 when the votes are unrestricted. As a counter, we study the behavior of voting rules when the vote distribution is a uniform mixture of a small number of multinomial logit distributions. This scenario corresponds to a population consisting of a small number of groups, each voting according to a latent preference ranking. We show that for any such voting profile on g groups, at least 1/2g fraction of the population prefers the winner of a Borda election to any other candidate.},

As delegations are transitive, delegates can choose to vote directly or to delegate their votes further. Transitivity can cause delegation cycles, making it unclear how to determine these votes. Our generalisation allows for ranked delegations in order to break delegation cycles. Agents can also give more expressive delegations than in liquid democracy, being able to state how their vote should be determined from the votes of others. For example, an agent may want their vote to correspond to the majority opinion of a group of trusted experts. We focus on how to gain a collective decision in this setting; we propose six unravelling procedures that find a standard voting profile, from the complex ballots, that can be aggregated. We study the properties of these unravelling procedures, including the complexity of finding an outcome, as well as axiomatic properties of the procedures. Following this, we lay out some future research directions.},

By contrast, I argue that problems of international cooperation have a common strategic structure in which a third, distinct obstacle plays a crucial role. Almost regardless of the issue area, states must first resolve the bargaining problem of agreeing on terms before they can implement and begin to enforce an agreement. Furthermore, the bargaining and enforcement problems interact. Using a game model, I show that if states must bargain to determine the deal to be enforced, the "shadow of the future" cuts two ways. A high expectation of continued interactions may make enforcing the agreelnent easier, but it can also give states an incentive to bargain harder, delaying agreement in hopes of getting a better deal. Empirical evidence from trade and arms control negotiations suggests that this mechanism may help to explain the costly standoffs that are often observed in international politics and are problematic for received neoliberal theories.},

Viewing each social choice setting as voting in a suitable metric space, we offer a general model of social choice over metric spaces, in which—similarly to the spatial model of elections—each voter specifies an ideal element of the metric space. The ideal element acts as a vote, where each voter prefers elements that are closer to her ideal element. But it also acts as a proposal, thus making all participants equal not only as voters but also as proposers. We consider Condorcet aggregation and a continuum of solution concepts, ranging from minimizing the sum of distances to minimizing the maximum distance. We study applications of our abstract model to various social choice settings, including single-winner elections, committee elections, participatory budgeting, and participatory legislation. For each setting, we compare each solution concept to known voting rules and study various properties of the resulting voting rules. Our framework provides expressive aggregation for a broad range of social choice settings while remaining simple for voters; and may enable a unified and integrated implementation for all these settings, as well as unified extensions such as sybil-resiliency, proxy voting, and deliberative decision making.&nbsp;},

Focusing on group accuracy we contrast this centralized solution with the setting in which agents are free to choose their weighted delegations by greedily trying to maximize their own individual accuracy. While equilibria with weighted delegations may be as bad as with standard delegations, they are never worse and may sometimes be better. To gain further insights into this model we experimentally study quantal response delegation strategies on random networks. We observe that weighted delegations can lead, under specific conditions, to higher group accuracy than simple majority voting.},
