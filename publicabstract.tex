    Proxy voting is a type of voting where individuals are able to pass their votes to
    someone else so they may vote for them.
    This type of voting system allows for those without the time or knowledge necessary
    to become informed on a topic to pass their votes to an individual they trust who
    knows more about the topic, dubbed an expert.
    This study investigates the ability of a proposed system to be used as a way to
    replace expensive, but highly accurate, measurements with less expensive,
    though less accurate, measurements through the use of proxy voting.
% \vicki{You talk about a more accurate way of taking measurements.
% Voting isnâ€™t normally about measurements, so we need clarification of the setup.}
