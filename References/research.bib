  abstract        = {Space and special FPGA applications must consider the radiation effects. Radiation Hardened by Design (RHBD) includes triple redundancy (Triple Modular Redundancy, TMR). Therefore, in FPGA, it is necessary to triple the architecture with separate power supplies. FPGA's Majority Vote Circuits can based on the Look-Up Tables. However, in this case FPGA logic resources are spent. In the Xilinx FPGA Virtex TMR uses internal 3-state buffers instead of Look-Up Tables (LUTs). Simulation shows that in this case six buffers per output are required. The third option uses three buffers and three LUT Minority Vote Circuit. Only in this case, there is no conflict of signals at the outputs of buffers. In this case, the costs are even greater. The paper proposes a fault tolerant 3-State Buffers Based Vote Circuit. Simulation confirms correct functioning of the proposed option and evaluation shows high probability of failure-free operation.},

  abstract   = {We consider a social choice problem where only a small number of people out of a large population are sufficiently available or motivated to vote. A common solution to increase participation is to allow voters use a proxy, that is, transfer their voting rights to another voter. Considering social choice problems on metric spaces, we compare voting with and without the use of proxies to see which mechanism better approximates the optimal outcome, and characterize the regimes in which proxy voting is beneficial. When voters' opinions are located on an interval, both the median mechanism and the mean mechanism are substantially improved by proxy voting. When voters vote on many binary issues, proxy voting is better when the sample of active voters is too small to provide a good outcome. Our theoretical results extend to situations where available voters choose strategically whether to participate. We support our theoretical findings with empirical results showing substantial benefits of proxy voting on simulated and real preference data.},
