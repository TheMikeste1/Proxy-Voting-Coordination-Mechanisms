  abstract        = {Space and special FPGA applications must consider the radiation effects. Radiation Hardened by Design (RHBD) includes triple redundancy (Triple Modular Redundancy, TMR). Therefore, in FPGA, it is necessary to triple the architecture with separate power supplies. FPGA's Majority Vote Circuits can based on the Look-Up Tables. However, in this case FPGA logic resources are spent. In the Xilinx FPGA Virtex TMR uses internal 3-state buffers instead of Look-Up Tables (LUTs). Simulation shows that in this case six buffers per output are required. The third option uses three buffers and three LUT Minority Vote Circuit. Only in this case, there is no conflict of signals at the outputs of buffers. In this case, the costs are even greater. The paper proposes a fault tolerant 3-State Buffers Based Vote Circuit. Simulation confirms correct functioning of the proposed option and evaluation shows high probability of failure-free operation.},
